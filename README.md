# üöß GSoC-PAL-Demo

A simulation project demonstrating a basic intralogistics robot in **Gazebo Harmonic** with **ROS 2 Jazzy**, including a custom sensor plugin called `DummySensor`. This repo contains the full setup of a mobile robot and shows how to integrate and extend simulation capabilities using ROS 2 and gz-transport.

## üîç About Each Package

### `fws_robot_description`
- Contains the robot‚Äôs URDF description.
- Files modified:
  - `robots/fws_robot.urdf.xacro`
  - `gazebo/fws_robot.gazebo.xacro`

### `fws_robot_sim`
- Sets up the simulation environment.
- Launches robot + world using Gazebo Harmonic.

### `velocity_pub`
- A ROS 2 node that publishes velocity commands to the robot (using `geometry_msgs/Twist`).

### `dummy_sensor`
- A **custom Gazebo plugin** written in C++.
- On load, it publishes `"Hello World"` to a ROS 2 topic using `gz-transport`.
- Demonstrates how to create and attach a custom sensor to your robot.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

### Clone into a ROS2 Workspace

```bash
mkdir -p demo_ws/src
cd demo_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/pedroazeredo04/GSoC-PAL-Demo.git
```

### Launch the Simulation

```bash
cd demo_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch fws_robot_sim sim_launch.py
```

This will:
- Launch Gazebo Harmonic
- Spawn the `fws_robot`
- Include the custom `DummySensor` plugin
- Print the following stuff in terminal:

```
Dummy Sensor loaded and message published!
Message received: Hello world from dummy sensor
```

## Steps to get Gazebo Harmonic Running in my PC

In order to run Gazebo Harmonic integrated with ROS 2 Jazzy, I first had to migrate my system from Ubuntu 22.04 to Ubuntu 24.04. Although Gazebo Harmonic is technically compatible with ROS 2 Humble (which runs on Ubuntu 22.04), this combination is not ideal for long-term development or feature compatibility. Knowing this, I decided it was more robust to update my entire development environment.

With that explained, the steps to set up Gazebo Harmonic and ROS 2 Jazzy on my machine were as follows:

1. **System Migration**  
   Performed a clean installation of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, ensuring compatibility with ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic.

2. **ROS 2 Jazzy Installation**  
   Followed the official installation procedure for ROS 2 Jazzy, including environment setup and workspace initialization, following [this tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)

3. **Gazebo Harmonic Installation**  
   Installed Gazebo Harmonic, ensuring it was the correct version built for Ubuntu 24.04. This included adding the necessary apt repositories and keys provided by Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), using [this tutorial](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/install_ubuntu/#binary-installation-on-ubuntu)

4. **Validation**  
   Validated the installation by running the examples from the Gazebo Harmonic home screen.

## üí° Credits

The packages `fws_robot_description`, `fws_robot_sim` and `velocity_pub` were based on the [YouTube tutorial by Robot Mania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8VwSsbZYn0), and were adapted and modified for this project.
